This library is basically "stolen code" from MvvmCross [Messenger Plugin](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Plugins/tree/master/Messenger)
removing any dependency on MvvmCross so it can be used in any kind of project.

Check out their docs here: [https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/wiki/MvvmCross-plugins#messenger](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/wiki/MvvmCross-plugins#messenger)
